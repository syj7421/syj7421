## Hi I'm Sooyoung Jung ðŸ‘‹
I love building Chrome extensions and mobile apps, always focusing on creating the simplest, most user-friendly experience. Seeing seniors (like my parents) and tech-averse friends struggle with overly complex apps made me realize how crucial accessibility is.

These days, Iâ€™m into Python and React (JS is tolerable too), and Iâ€™m currently learning C#, Azure, and Deepseek APIs.
